        <strong>Mezcal is distilled from the agave plant in Mexico. The name comes from the indigenou Nahuatl word "mexicalli" meaning cooked agave</strong>
        <span>In order to preserve its true origin, mezcal can be only produced in one of the certified Mexican states, with Oaxaca as the leading producer</span>
        <span>It is traditionally served at room temperature, but it is also a pleasing ingredient in a range of other cocktails</span>
        <span>Mezcal is a drink for every occasion, but it is much more than this. It preserves tradition and contains a cosmic energy of the sun</span>
